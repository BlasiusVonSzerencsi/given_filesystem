# How to contribute

Contributions to GivenFilesystem are welcome. Its home project is at
https://github.com/cornelius/given_filesystem.

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug please report it as an issue on the GitHub project. If
possible include a test case. If you want to go for the perfect bug report
include a patch and open a pull request.

## Contributing code

If you want to fix bugs, add new functionality, or improve existing one, open
a pull request. All code has to come with tests and be written according to
the style used in the rest of the code. I also welcome proof-of-concept code
which is meant to be discussed, and be polished into production code later.
Code review is fun.

## Sending feedback and asking questions

If you have any feedback to share or would just like to ask a question, please
don't hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:schumacher@kde.org).
